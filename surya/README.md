# SÅ«rya, The Sun God: A Solidity Inspector 

#### 

Surya is an utility tool for smart contract systems. It provides a number of visual outputs and information about the contracts' structure. Also supports querying the function call graph in multiple ways to aid in the manual inspection of contracts.

Currently only supports Solidity but we hope to extend the tool to encompass other languages.

The name stems from the sun deity [Surya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya)

Why the sun, you ask? Because "sun" in latin and portuguese is [*Sol*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_deity).


## Getting Started

Install it via npm:

```shell
npm install -g surya
```

Currently, however, the easiest way to use Surya in your project might be through [VSCode's Solidity Auditor extension](https://github.com/tintinweb/vscode-solidity-auditor) created by [@tintinweb](https://github.com/tintinweb)

## Command List

Surya takes in a `--no-color` option with any command that disables the colors in the output making it effectively plain text.

All the commands that take in an array of files also take in a flag (`-i`/`--import`) that resolves file imports automatically.
Please be aware that in the case you use Truffle's "node_modules" remapping import statements, Surya searches up the project directory recursively until it finds a `contracts` directory in the Truffle project *up until the directory you ran the command in*. This is so that we try to prevent any kind of path traversal vulnerabilities that could come from exposing Surya as a service.

### describe

The `describe` command shows a summary of the contracts and methods in the files provided.

```shell
surya describe *.sol
```

Functions will be listed as:

* `[Pub]` public
* `[Ext]` external
* `[Prv]` private
* `[Int]` internal

A yellow `($)`denotes a function is `payable`.

A red `#` indicates that it's able to modify state.

### graph

The `graph` command outputs a DOT-formatted graph of the control flow.

```shell
surya graph contracts/**/*.sol | dot -Tpng > MyContract.png
```

### inheritance

The `inheritance` command outputs a DOT-formatted graph of the inheritance tree.

```shell
surya inheritance MyContract.sol | dot -Tpng > MyContract.png
```

### dependencies

The `dependencies` command outputs the [c3-linearization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C3_linearization) of a given contract's inheritance graph. Contracts will be listed starting with most-derived, ie. if the same function is defined in more than one contract, the solidity compiler will use the definition in whichever contract is listed first. 

```shell
surya dependencies Exchange Exchange.sol
```

### flatten

The `flatten` command outputs a flattened version of the source code, with all import statements replaced by the corresponding source code. Import statements that reference a file that has already been imported, will simply be commented out. 

```shell
surya flatten MyContract.sol
```

### parse

The `parse` command outputs a "treefied" AST object coming from the parser.

```shell
surya parse MyContract.sol
```

### ftrace

The `ftrace` command outputs a "treefied" function call trace stemming from the defined "CONTRACT::FUNCTION" and traversing "all|internal|external" types of calls.
External calls are marked in `orange` and internal calls are `uncolored`.

```shell
surya ftrace APMRegistry::_newRepo all MyContract.sol
```

### mdreport

The `mdreport` command creates a markdown description report with tables comprising information about the system's files, contracts and their functions.

```shell
surya mdreport report_outfile.md MyContract.sol
```
